            I know I have been annoying to you since I was a kid. Even then you still kept your patience sometimes. I hope you know that I will be there for you when you need to talk. I won't call you. That is how I am. I love you, but I will rarely check up on you. We have so many things that we experience together. I hope you remember them. I remember how we would tap our hand to let each other know if mom is coming. 
            I am sorry for the times during your university at Yangon for not noticing you are suffering from your boyfriend. You were able to help me when I was sad at home. So please let me know if you need someone to talk to. I am pretty confident that I will be able to understand you. We spend almost our years together. I will be your confidant.
            As for your hobby, I believed that you will become one of the best artist. Even Van Gogh started late in his career. His earlier works were not perfect either. Remember your dream of opening your own exhibition. Stop hurting yourself. I hope my words help you reach your dream. 
            I love you and thank you for everything that you have did for me. I am not good at saying thanks but I hope this tell you that you are one of my special people.
